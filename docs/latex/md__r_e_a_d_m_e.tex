A simple set of python scripts and libraries to work with movies. I use it with my Dream\-Box.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Homepage\-: \href{http://elchi.github.io/movies2hdd}{\tt http\-://elchi.\-github.\-io/movies2hdd} (It is empty.)
\item Documentation of the A\-P\-I\-: \href{http://elchi.github.io/movies2hdd/docs/html/}{\tt http\-://elchi.\-github.\-io/movies2hdd/docs/html/} (generated using doxygen) 


\end{DoxyItemize}

Why should I use it?
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It is written entirely in Python.
\item It supports both 2.\-7 {\itshape and} 3 {\itshape at the same time}. (!)
\item It is a class.
\item It is not finished. 


\end{DoxyItemize}

How do I install it?

Just simply type {\ttfamily make install}. You can run it via {\ttfamily \hyperlink{namespacemovies2hdd}{movies2hdd}}.

I'll try to provide a debian package for the next release.
